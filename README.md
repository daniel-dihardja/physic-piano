# Collision Symphony

![Collision Symphony Demo](demo.gif)

Collision Symphony is an exciting prototype web application that combines the power of p5.js, Box2D, and the magenta piano model to create a mesmerizing 2D physics-based experience. 

## Features

- **Real-time Collision Visualization**: Witness collisions in the 2D world come to life as vibrant nodes, thanks to the magenta piano model.
- **Interactive Physics Simulation**: Interact with the simulated objects and see how they react dynamically to your actions.
- **Customizable Environment**: Modify the parameters of the physics simulation and experiment with different scenarios.
- **Responsive and Intuitive Interface**: Enjoy a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices with an intuitive user interface.

## How It Works

Collision Symphony utilizes the powerful p5.js library to handle the graphical rendering and interactivity, while Box2D, a 2D physics library, provides realistic physics simulations. The collisions between objects trigger the generation of musical nodes based on the magenta piano model, creating a harmonious symphony of visuals and sounds.
